commitacceptance.title.versionCommitRules=Version Control Commit Rules
commitacceptance.description.0=The VCS Commit Acceptance plugin allows you to disallow commits to your version control repository \
		based on certain rules defined here. When you attempt a new commit to your repository, pre-commit \
		scripts (see <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAEXT/Commit+Acceptance+Plugin">docs</a>) will \
		contact JIRA and process the commit info and log message based on the criteria below.
commitacceptance.description.1=You can configure global (site-wide) rules and refer to those from the actual projects, or configure \
		project specific rules separately for any of your JIRA projects.

commitacceptance.field.projectKey.values.global=Global
commitacceptance.field.projectKey.values.group.project=Project

commitacceptance.field.mustBeAssignedToCommiter.label=All issues referenced in the log message must be assigned to the committer.

This is however in use for concrete projects inheriting the global settings.
